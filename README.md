# LabFinalProject
This is my lab final project for NMD 211.
I had a fairly hard time coming up with a project that I wanted to create with the arduino components. After many sleepless nights I finally settled on making a fairly basic but pretty fun art project.
My plan was to use the DC motor with a writing utensil attached to it in order to create random pieces of artwork. 

Here are the photos of my project:

Reflection:
  I think the main attribute of my project is its randomness. This allows for you to create something new everytime it is turned on. A major flaw within my project is the unreliability of the DC motor. The DC motor often fluctuates through different speeds, even though it is set to a constant speed in the code. I believe that this is a product of having the pen attached to the DC motor. Well making this project I learned just how precise you need to be while constructing arduino components, as even one wire being slightly unplugged can mess up the entire thing. If I could improve anything with my project I would try to make the pen a little less scratchy and instead create more looping spirals.
